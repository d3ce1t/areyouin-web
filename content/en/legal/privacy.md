  <h3>Information we collect</h3>
  <h4>Registration information</h4>
  <p>By registering in AreYouIN you provide us the following personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your name,</li>
    <li>your e-mail address, and</li>
    <li>a profile picture where it is likely you may appear.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you sign in with a Facebook account, you are also providing to us information about who you are on Facebook. However, to create your user account, AreYouIN only access your name, e-mail, profile picture and friends who already use the service. In other words, AreYouIN cannot see all of your Facebook friends, but only those who already use the service. We will never ask for permission to access more information than this.</p>

  <h4>Information about your friends</h4>
  <p>Also at the time of registration, if you sign in with a Facebook account, or add a friend through an e-mail address (or any other method available) you provide us with information about your friends. There are two cases depending on whether or not your friend is already registered in AreYouIN:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>If your friend is a registered user</strong>. In this case, the only information you provide is the one that links you to another AreYouIN user.</li>
    <li><strong>If your friend is NOT a registered user</strong>. In this case, you only provide us the e-mail address of your friend so that we can send him or her an invitation on your behalf. This way, your friend will be able to join AreYouIN and enjoy the benefits of this service.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="legal-info">
  <h3>How we use information we collect</h3>
  <p>Data collected during registration is used to create your user account and, therefore, to differentiate yourself from other users. This is important so that other users can recognize you in their friends list and to know who is the author of a published event.</p>
  <p>Your name and profile picture are shared with other users through events authored by you or in which you participate. For example, when you publish an event your name will be visible as author and in the participants list. Similarly, when you are invited to an event your name will also be visible in the participants list. It is important to note that your profile picture will be visible in the list of participants by your friends only.</p>
  <p>When you invite a friend to AreYouIN that is not registered yet, the email address you provide us is used solely to send an e-mail invitation in your name.</p>
  <p>Besides, yours and the friends list of other users may be used to make friend suggestions of people you may already know. Similarly, information about your events may be used to suggest you other users with your same interests.</p>

<div class="legal-info">
  <h3>Updating your personal information</h3>
  <p>You can modify your personal information in AreYouIN app.</p>
  <p>When you change your personal data such as name or profile picture we do not keep a copy of previous information except under the following exceptions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your old name will still be visible in previous events authored by you or that you have participated.</li>
    <li>When you recently change your profile picture it may take some time for other users to see your new picture.</li>
    <li>Your name and profile picture will be preserved in any backup that may exist due to regular operational or maintenance tasks.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="legal-info">
  <h3>Information you share</h3>
  <p>When using AreYouIN you share information, like events, with other users. We are aware that events authored by you may contain personal information. For example, you or your friends may appear in the event picture you upload. On the other hand, the event description could reveal your date of birth or other personal information. However, we understand that you share this information with other users at your own risk so that events do not receive special treatment to protect the personal information that may appear on them.</p>
